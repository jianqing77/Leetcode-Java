# 2. Merge Sort

<details>

<summary>Process</summary>

* **Divide**: The input array is repeatedly divided into two halves until each subarray contains only one element or is empty.
* **Conquer**: The subarrays are recursively sorted using merge sort. This is done by applying the divide-and-conquer approach to each subarray.
* **Merge**: The sorted subarrays are merged to produce a single sorted array. This involves comparing elements from the two subarrays and placing them in the correct order.

```java
Initial Array: [6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4]

Dividing:
[6, 5, 3, 1]   [8, 7, 2, 4]
Dividing:
[6, 5]   [3, 1]   [8, 7]   [2, 4]
Dividing:
[6]   [5]   [3]   [1]   [8]   [7]   [2]   [4]

Merging: (with sort)
[5, 6]   [1, 3]   [7, 8]   [2, 4]
Merging:  (with sort)
[1, 3, 5, 6]   [2, 4, 7, 8]
Merging:  (with sort)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Sorted Array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

<summary>Complexity Analysis</summary>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Divide:**</mark>&#x20;

* &#x20;Input array is continuously divided into halves until subarrays of size 1 are reached.
* As the subproblem size decrease by fector of 2 each time we go down one level, we eventually must have a boundary condition. The sub-problem size for a node at depth `i` is $$n/2^i$$ . when the sub-problem hits 1,  when $$n/2^i = 1$$, or equivalently $$i   = logn$$ . Thus, this process requires $$\log n$$ depth of recursion, where n is the size of the input array.

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Conquer**</mark>

* In the conquer step, each subarray is merged back together. The time complexity of merging two sorted subarrays of size $$n/2$$ is $$O(n)$$ as each element needs to be compared and placed in the correct order.

Therefore, the total time complexity of merge sort can be expressed as: $$T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)$$

This recurrence relation is solved using the master theorem. In the case of merge sort, the master theorem can be applied to determine the time complexity.
