# 3. Overflow

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">Mid Overflow</mark>

<mark style="color:yellow;">**Integer overflow**</mark> is a condition that occurs when the result of an arithmetic operation, such as addition or multiplication, exceeds the maximum size of the integer type that can be represented.

In Java, the maximum positive value for an `int` is `2^31 - 1` or `2147483647`. So let's consider an example where `right = 2147483647` (max int value) and `left = 1000000000`. If you use the traditional way to calculate the midpoint, `(left + right) / 2`, it would result in an overflow:

```java
int left = 1000000000;
int right = 2147483647;
int mid = (left + right) / 2;  // Overflow occurs here
```

The sum of `left` and `right` is `3147483647`, which exceeds the max int value, causing an integer overflow. This results in a negative value for `mid`, which is not what we want.

The expression `left + (right - left) / 2` avoids this problem. The difference `(right - left)` is guaranteed to be a non-negative number that fits in an `int`. This difference is divided by `2` before being added to `left`, so the overall result also fits in an `int`:

```java
int left = 1000000000;
int right = 2147483647;
int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;  // mid is 1573741823, as expected
```

In this case, `mid` is computed correctly as `1573741823`, without causing an overflow.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**use mid < x/mid rather than mid\*mid < x**</mark>

Note that the code uses `x / mid` instead of `mid * mid` to prevent integer overflow. If `mid` is large, `mid * mid` could exceed the maximum value that can be represented by an `int`. By using `x / mid`, the code avoids this problem, since `x / mid` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `mid`.
