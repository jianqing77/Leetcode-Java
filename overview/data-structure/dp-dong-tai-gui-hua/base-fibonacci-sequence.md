<summary>When use DP?</summary>

1 . <mark style="color:yellow;">**Optimum Value:**</mark>** ask for optimum value**

**The first characteristic** that is common in DP problems is that the problem will <mark style="color:green;">**ask for the optimum value**</mark> (maximum or minimum) of something, or the number of ways there are to do something. For example:

* What is the minimum cost of doing...
* What is the maximum profit from...
* How many ways are there to do...
* What is the longest possible...
* Is it possible to reach a certain point...

2\. <mark style="color:yellow;">**Overlapping Subproblem:**</mark> **future "decisions" depend on earlier decisions**

Deciding to <mark style="color:red;">**do something at one step may affect the ability to do something in a later step.**</mark> This characteristic is what makes a greedy algorithm invalid for a DP problem - we need to factor in results from previous decisions.
