# 2131 - Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words

<details>

<summary>Problem Description</summary>

You are given an array of strings `words`. Each element of `words` consists of **two** lowercase English letters.

Create the **longest possible palindrome** by selecting some elements from `words` and concatenating them in **any order**. Each element can be selected **at most once**.

Return _the **length** of the longest palindrome that you can create_. If it is impossible to create any palindrome, return `0`.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["lc","cl","gg"]
</strong><strong>Output: 6
</strong><strong>Explanation: One longest palindrome is "lc" + "gg" + "cl" = "lcggcl", of length 6.
</strong>Note that "clgglc" is another longest palindrome that can be created.
</code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: words = ["ab","ty","yt","lc","cl","ab"]
</strong><strong>Output: 8
</strong><strong>Explanation: One longest palindrome is "ty" + "lc" + "cl" + "yt" = "tylcclyt", of length 8.
</strong>Note that "lcyttycl" is another longest palindrome that can be created.
</code></pre>
